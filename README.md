# SMAbacktester
Developed and evaluated systematic trading strategies using simple moving average (SMA) signals across multiple U.S. equities, including AAPL, KO, SPY, UNH, WMT, and AMZN, with historical data sourced via yfinance. 

Conducted initial exploratory analysis through normalized return plots, risk-return scatterplots, and correlation heatmaps to assess performance dynamics and asset correlations. 

Implemented and backtested a traditional 50-day/200-day SMA crossover strategy, which underperformed relative to a passive buy-and-hold benchmark. The strategy was then adjusted to incorporate a long-only bias, motivated by an observed upward drift in equity markets, resulting in improved returns and reduced drawdowns.
